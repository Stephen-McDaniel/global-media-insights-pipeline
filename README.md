**End-to-End Data Engineering & Strategic Insight Generation**

I designed and executed the full analytics pipeline—leveraging **Snowflake** for data infrastructure, **Python** for data wrangling, and **Tableau** for interactive dashboards. Partnering closely with Marketing and Sales executives, I transformed complex media data from Kinetiq’s platform into a political insights case study that revealed how global audiences engaged with President Trump’s Address to Congress.

**The World Watched Trump’s Address. But What Did They See?**

**Hits by Second of Speech**
Based on worldwide detections of post-speech coverage, which countries were the top to discuss his speech? You can drill into specific sections of his talk, by second, and see which countries discussed that the most.

**Key Findings Delivered**
* **Top Moments:** Identified the most replayed segments worldwide, including Trump’s shoutout to Elon Musk, with the U.S., Canada, Italy, and France leading coverage.
* **Economic Hotspots:** Analyzed tariff discussions dominating coverage in Canada (20%) and Central Europe (Romania 38%, Albania 33%).
* **Global Priorities:** Highlighted China’s emphasis on U.S. military strength vs. smaller nations’ focus on peace and foreign policy.
* **Airtime Leaders:** Quantified which countries re-aired the speech most, led by the U.S., Canada, Brazil, and Italy.

**Impact**
This project demonstrated how **data engineering and strategic analysis** can uncover actionable insights for political and media stakeholders. By connecting data architecture with executive-level storytelling, the study advanced Kinetiq’s positioning as a leader in global media intelligence.
